# DIY STM

This repos contains my attempt at building a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The project is based on the `Open STM: A low-cost scanning tunneling microscope with a fast approach method` [paper](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/f35c6xzzcm/1). The paper provides a detailed description of the hardware and software used in the STM.
